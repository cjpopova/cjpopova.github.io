## About me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Lab for Programming Languages at the University of Maryland (PLUM)](https://plum-umd.github.io/) advised by [David Van Horn](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dvanhorn/index.html) and [Leo Lampropoulas](https://lemonidas.github.io/). 

I am broadly interested in compilers, property based testing, and contracts. I am currently working on random testing recursion-related optimizations in compilers. My goal is to build a program generator of recursive programs by using sized typing to ensure termination. [Here](https://cjpopova.github.io/_site/assets/docs/sized-types-slides-2025-09-18.pdf) are slides from a tutorial talk on sized typing I gave.

## News
I am currently looking for summer 2026 internships!

## More information
My work is supported by the NSF (CSGrad4US award #2313998): I am a [2023 NSF CSGrad4US Fellow](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships). I encourage any undergraduate or master's students who are planning to do a Ph.D. after an industry break to apply to this fellowship & mentorship program.

Previously, I was advised by [Christos Dimoulas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~chrdimo/) at Northwestern University as an undergraduate. I worked on the [higher order (HO) benchmarks project](https://github.com/cjpopova/gt-benchmarks) with [Lukas Lazarek](https://llazarek.github.io/home.html). I also contributed to the [MemOIR](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/files/Research/papers/MEMORY_CGO_2024.pdf) project in the [Arcana compilers group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html).

Between UMD and NWU, I spent [2 years in industry at Epic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caspar-popova/) with Healthy Planet (population health) Analytics. 

Have we met before? I'd love to hear from you!
I was at:
- NJPLS May 2025 @ Jane Street
- POPL 2025 @ Denver (student volunteer)
- OPLSS 2022 @ Oregon
- OOPSLA 2021 @ Chicago
