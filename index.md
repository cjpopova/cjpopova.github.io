## About me
2024+: I am Ph.D. student in the [Lab for Programming Languages at the University of Maryland (PLUM)](https://plum-umd.github.io/) advised by [David Van Horn](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dvanhorn/index.html). I am interested in gradual typing and program synthesis.

I am also an [NSF CSGrad4US Fellow](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships).

2022: Previously, I was advised by [Christos Dimoulas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~chrdimo/) at Northwestern University as an undergraduate. I worked on the [HO-benchmarks project](https://github.com/cjpopova/gt-benchmarks) with [Lukas Lazarek](https://llazarek.github.io/home.html). I also contributed to the [MemOIR](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/files/Research/papers/MEMORY_CGO_2024.pdf) project in the [Arcana compilers group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html).

Between UMD and NU, I spent [2 years in industry at Epic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caspar-popova/).
